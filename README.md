# Dreamer-Studios
1st year group assignment

      This brings my first year group assignment as a university student.The task assigned to the group of five
      students was to create a website under a theme of their choice.
There our team decided to create a website under photography and used the name "Dreamer Studios". Photography is categorized under each theme and detailed descriptions are
provided along with the relevant images.The customer will also be able to make their payments online after availing the service through this studio.
  
This assignment is based on these facts and I have included here only the work assigned to me by the team of five.In terms of pages, I have created the navigation bar, header and 
footer of the website including
                                  * [About US Page](#About-US-Page)
                                  * [Category Page](#Category-Page)
                                  * [Account Page](#Account-Page)
